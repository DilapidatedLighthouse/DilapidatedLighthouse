## Me - Josiah
I'm an applied mathematics PhD student studying the mechanics of railway infrastructure.

## To do:
 - [x] Figure out how to make GitHub profile
 - [x] Figure out how to edit GitHub profile using code
 - [x] Spend far too long not doing assignments and instead trying to make an API call in node.js
 - [x] Figure out how to use GitHub actions
 - [x] Automate my profile updating script
 - [ ] Actually do something interesting with my newfound skills
 - [ ] Finish making this profile page
