# Hey! Welcome.

## Me - Josiah
I'm a 4th year applied mathematics student studying partial differential equations. On occasion, I have some coding to do for uni, but I also tinker with personal projects in my free time. I've been looking to take my coding up a notch and thought GitHub would be a good place to start!
